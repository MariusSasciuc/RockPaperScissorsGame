# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This is a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game developed in **C#**, where a player competes against the computer. The game allows you to choose between three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer generates a random move in response. The result is evaluated based on the classic game rules.

## How to Play

1. **Run the game**: After starting the game, the current score between the player and computer is displayed.
2. **Make your choice**: The game will prompt you to pick one of the following:
   - 1: Rock
   - 2: Paper
   - 3: Scissors
3. **Computer's turn**: The computer randomly selects one of the options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
4. **Result**: The game evaluates who wins:
   - **Rock** beats **Scissors**.
   - **Scissors** beat **Paper**.
   - **Paper** beats **Rock**.
5. **Score tracking**: After each round, the scores are updated and displayed.
6. **Play again or quit**: After each round, you'll be asked if you'd like to play again (y/n). You can choose to replay or quit, and the final score will be shown.
